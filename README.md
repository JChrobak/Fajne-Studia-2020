Simple Android app that can aid you in learning.
Just copy all the questions to your phone and get ready to learn.

Every data set is validated and must abide by those formatting rules
- Question: line of text ended by the new line character
- Answer: 0 or 1 (false or true)
- Explanation: line of text

Multiple questions are divided with the new line character.

Example of correct data:

```
Does 2+2=4?
1
I don't think that this needs an explanation.
Does 2+3=0
0
Sum of two numbers that are bigger than 0 is always bigger than 0.
```
Currently this app only supports true or false questions but I might expand it to single choice questions.
